## 1. **Introduction**  
Welcome to the **Diabetic Retinopathy Classification Project—a Streamlit-based web application** that enables:
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Utilizes deep learning models for accurate detection of diabetic retinopathy
- **Multi-Language Support**: Available in English, Arabic, French, and Spanish
- **Interactive Chatbot**: AI assistant to answer questions about diabetic retinopathy
- **Detailed Reports**: Generates comprehensive PDF reports with analysis results
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive and accessible design for all users


This tool supports both healthcare professionals and patients, making early diagnosis and education more accessible through explainable AI and a friendly interface.

## 2. **Project Overview**

This project is divided into *three main components*, each developed and maintained in a dedicated branch:

### 2.1 **Disease Grading**  
We trained multiple models to *predict the grade of diabetic retinopathy* from fundus images. The grades are:
- 0: No DR
- 1: Mild
- 2: Moderate
- 3: Severe
- 4: Proliferative DR

#### ✅ Models used:
- *MobileNetV2*  
- *EfficientNet-B0 and EfficientNet-B7*  
- *Swin Transformer*

After experiments, *MobileNetV2* was selected for deployment based on its balance of performance and speed. We also integrated *Grad-CAM* to visualize which parts of the retina the model used for its decisions.  
All experiments and results are available in the notebooks under the **detection branch**.



### 2.2 **Exudate Segmentation**  
This part aims to *segment exudates*—bright lesions in the retina that appear due to leakage from blood vessels and are key signs of diabetic retinopathy progression.

#### 🔍 Why Exudates?  
Exudates are among the earliest clinical signs of DR. Accurate segmentation helps:
- Understand lesion load,
- Guide diagnosis/treatment,
- Enable fine-grained analysis for early detection.

We used a segmentation architecture trained on expert-annotated data. Notebooks and scripts can be found in the **segmentation branch**.



### 2.3 **Interactive Chatbot**  
This module features a *RAG-based (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot* that answers *medical questions* about diabetic retinopathy using reliable medical sources.

#### 🤖 Capabilities:
- Understands queries about symptoms, causes, treatments, grading systems, etc.
- Retrieves relevant info from documents and generates answers.
- Built to assist *clinicians and patients* in gaining instant access to trustworthy knowledge.

You can find the chatbot pipeline and Streamlit app in the **chatbot branch**.
